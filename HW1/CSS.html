            <p><b>The iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc. that use Apple's iOS mobile operating system. The first-generation iPhone was announced by then-Apple CEO Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then, Apple has annually released new iPhone models and iOS updates. As of November 1, 2018, more than 2.2 billion iPhones had been sold.</b></p>
            <p><b>The iPad is a brand of iOS and iPadOS-based tablet computers developed by Apple Inc. It is the successor of the Newton MessagePad and an unreleased prototype of the PowerBook Duo-based tablet computer. Apple conceived of the iPad before the related iPhone, although the latter was developed and released first. Speculations of the original iPad began in 2002, and dealt with its development, operating system, and release, prior to its introduction on January 20, 2010. It consists of four lineups, the original iPad lineup and three flagships, iPad Mini, iPad Air, and iPad Pro.</b></p>
            <p><b>The MacBook is a brand of Macintosh notebook computers designed and marketed by Apple Inc. that use Apple's macOS operating system since 2006. It replaced the PowerBook and iBook brands during the Mac transition to Intel processors, announced in 2005. The current lineup consists of the MacBook Air (2008–present) and the MacBook Pro (2006–present). Two different lines simply named "MacBook" existed from 2006 to 2012 and 2015 to 2019.</b></p>
